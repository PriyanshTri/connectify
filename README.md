We want to develop a website to help manage social media from a single central location. Users can link different social media accounts like Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc., and access them all in one place, receiving notifications centrally. There will also be a feature for posting one item across multiple accounts.

Developers - HimanshuChaudhary - A and PriyanshTri.
Tech Stack - MERN, Reudx, Redux Thunk, SCSS , CSS.
