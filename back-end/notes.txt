 the verifyJWT function you've shown is indeed a middleware function in Express.js. Middleware functions are used to perform operations 
 on the request and response objects, execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle
 , or call the next middleware function in the stack.

For a user to know that the middleware has passed the test (i.e., the user is authenticated successfully), 
several mechanisms can be employed:

Successful Response: If the middleware successfully authenticates the user, it attaches the user's information to the request object 
(req.user = user;). Subsequent middleware functions or route handlers can then access this information to determine if the user is 
authenticated. This is a common practice in Express applications to pass user information down the middleware chain.
Error Responses: If the middleware encounters an error (e.g., an invalid token or expired token), it sends an error response back to 
the client. This informs the client that the authentication attempt was unsuccessful. For example, if the token is missing or invalid, 
the middleware might respond with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) and a message indicating the issue.
Testing: As mentioned in 1, testing plays a crucial role in ensuring that the middleware behaves as expected. By writing tests that 
simulate various scenarios (e.g., valid token, invalid token, no token), developers can confirm that the middleware correctly handles
 these cases. This includes checking that the middleware allows access to protected resources when the token is valid and denies access
  otherwise.
Client-Side Logic: On the client side, the application logic should be designed to handle different types of responses from the server.
 For instance, upon receiving a successful response from a protected endpoint, the client-side application knows that the user is 
 authenticated and can proceed accordingly. Conversely, if the client receives an error response, it should handle this appropriately, 
 such as by prompting the user to log in again.
In summary, the user or client application determines whether the middleware has passed the test based on the response received from 
the server. Successful authentication leads to the user being granted access to protected resources, while errors indicate that the
authentication attempt was unsuccessful.
